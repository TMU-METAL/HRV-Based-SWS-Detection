# HRV-Based SWS Detection

This repository provides a complete pipeline for identifying the occurrence of Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features. The approach uses machine learning (Random Forest) combined with SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

## Project Overview

Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) plays a critical role in memory consolidation and physical recovery. Identifying SWS using non-invasive signals like HRV opens possibilities for sleep monitoring via wearable devices.

This project enables:
- Preprocessing of HRV data
- Balancing of imbalanced classes with SMOTE
- Training and evaluation using Random Forest
- Visualization of confusion matrix and performance metrics
